## Run Project

2. `npm start`

## To See Dashboard with Stats

- Go to the URL `/dashboard`

## Notes:

1. Dashboard works with `localStorage` without a backend, so different browsers will show different stats.
2. No strict checks for name/email/phone/card fields for more comfortable testing. A solid implementation of these checks requires a lot of work and isn't necessary for this test task.
